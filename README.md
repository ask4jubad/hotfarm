# HOTFARM

This project is solving the [Crop Alert â€“ Learning From the Growers](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/crop-alert-learning-growers/) challenge.
Hotfarm is a web-based application that can be accessed on cross-platforms i.e Mobile, Desktop computers, Tablet Pc's. It basically serves as assistant to farmers across West Africa who are plagued with crop pests and diseases that most times constitute great loss during harvest, so it helps farmers prepare, identify and solve problems regarding crop pests and diseases common to their location. It also allows them provide solutions to fellow agriculturists across their regions.
